Modules - 
- Are containers that allow components, directives, factories that you build for you app have a way to be organised into one container

Routes -
- Determines what routes/view gets loaded (path)

Views - 
- Within views, we can have directives, which enhance HTML
- We can have something called filters (they proved some data filtering functionality and can do simple things like uppercase data, lowercase data and more)

Logic/data
- Controller (brain for our views and get data or perform business rules against factories or services) - data is shared from the controller to the view via something called $scope
- Factories
- Services

What are factories/services?
- used to make restful calls
- Used to share data between controllers
- Used to ahndle custom Logic
- The are singletons

What is a controller?
- Controllers act as the "brain" for a view : Retrieve data from a factory/service and store it.
- They typically interact with a service/factory
- The by using the scope they can then bind that data into the view using directives defined in the view
